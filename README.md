## General Information
A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. 


In such an attempt, BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.

- The company wants to know:
    - Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
    - How well those variables describe the bike demands
    
- Business Goals:
    - To build a model to identify variables which are significant to the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables.
    - Model will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations.
    - The model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

## Conclusions
- Analysing the above model, the comapany should focus on the following features:
    - Company should focus on business during Holidays.
    - Company should focus on business during Month of Nov and Dec.
    - Company should focus on business during Sundays and Holidays.
    - Company should focus on business during Spring and Winters.
- When the situation comes back to Normal, Company can release some offers during above time to attract more customer based with discounts or attractive offers.
- There would always be less consumption during bad and severe weather, accordingly company can shift bikes to ports where wheather is normal and it can cover the loss of business due to less booking.
